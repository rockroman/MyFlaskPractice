<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree
   which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance.
   (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came and took it.)
   Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
   Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were
   preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
   prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered
   thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business,
   welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

      <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
      <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
         he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in
         exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of
         Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point
         in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained
         the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

      <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
      <p>
         Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
         Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
         nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]

      <h3>Óin</h3>
      <p>
         Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
         the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
         Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
         quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.

      <h3>Glóin</h3>
      <p>
         Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
         younger brother of Óin.
         In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
         Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
         In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March
         of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim
         Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron.

      <h3> Balin </h3>
      <p>
         Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
         named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
         Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which
         culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar

      <h3>Dwalin</h3>
      <p>
         Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
         younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
         Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

         Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo

         Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them.
         Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's
         Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

      <h3>Bifur</h3>
      <p>
         Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
         Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
         family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
         exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his
         halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

         Bofur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield,

      <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
      <p>
         Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year
         2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
         In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named
         Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
         A young Bilbo upon first meeting Gandalf
         As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took
         interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's
         Firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials.

         Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]), was
         an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin
         II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the
